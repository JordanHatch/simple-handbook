**Simple Handbook** is a ready-made static site template to create online documentation based on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files. 

It's built with the static-site generator [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and is preconfigured to automatically deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It's designed for teams who want to write clear documentation in the open, writing Markdown without having to deal with code and templates. 

Almost all the code stays out of the way, keeping your GitHub repository clean.
