# Simple Handbook

A basic handbook, built with Eleventy. Just add Markdown. Designed for ease of editing, keeping as much of the code out of the way as possible.

For documentation, visit the [online hosted version of this site](https://jordanhatch.github.io/simple-handbook/) or [index.md](index.md) in this repository.
