title: Configure the navigation bar and breadcrumbs

The navigation bar and breadcrumbs are set automaticaly, based on the folder structure of your pages.

[[toc]]

# Making pages appear in the navigation

To make this work, there are two things you need to do:

1. Always [set a page title](../page-title/)
2. Always create an `index.md` file in each folder you create

If your pages don't appear in the navigation bar, or if the title looks broken, check that you've done both of these.

# Setting the order that pages are listed

You can optionally set the order of pages in the navigation yourself.

To do this, include an `order` parameter for each page below [the title](../page-title/).

For example:

```
# introduction.md
---
title: Introduction
order: 0
---

# conclusion.md
---
title: Conclusion
order: 1
---
```

The number you give to `order` can be as high or low as you like - they don't need to be consecutive. 

If you don't set an `order` for a page, it will be treated the same as if it were set to `0`.

# Further technical reading

Behind the scenes, the navigation and breadcrumbs are generated by the [eleventy-navigation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation) plugin.
