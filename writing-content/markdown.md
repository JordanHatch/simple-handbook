Simple Handbook uses Markdown to format the content in its pages. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for styling plain text documents.

This means most of your content is written in files without the common styling you'd find in other software, like fonts, colours and sizes. Instead, you can style your content with simple characters - like using asterisks (`**`) to denote bold text, or hashes (`#`) for headings.

Markdown is designed to be easy to read from looking at the file itself. So whether you're reading this page on the web, or just looking at the raw file for editing, you'll have a similar experience.

You can write Markdown in a plain text editor or use specialised Markdown editing apps to help you. Online apps like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io) make it easy to import and edit content directly from GitHub, with a side-by-side preview of how your Markdown will appear.

Markdown files in Simple Handbook use the file extension `.md`. For example, the file containing the content for this page is called `markdown.md`.
